        <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone
            into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he
            better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
            men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
            darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon
            thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And
            you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>

        <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to
            the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more
            shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one
            of the ones that became nothing. </p>

        <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular
            gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with
            it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. </p>
